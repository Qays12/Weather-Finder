# Weather-Finder
I built this website using the django framework, that uses the openweather api to get you the weather of any city you type.

It's a simple design, needs more improvement such as mobile compatibility. Need to add animations, which will be added in due time.

I made this in a week, wanted to push myself and learn django.
